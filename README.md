# Book-Shop-Management
Hello Everyone, 
In this GitHub repository, I've created a menu driven Book Shop Management tool in python. Which uses MySQL to store data.

How to use:
1. install MySQL in your system.
2. Run the 'initial.py' file in this repository, which will create the needed database, tables, etc.
3. Run 'admin.py' file to manage the shop (eg to add books).
4. Run 'user.py' file if you're a visitor to the shop.

I hope you will love the project, suggestions are invited. :)

# Book-Shop-Management
Hello Everyone, 
In this GitHub repository, I've created a menu driven Book Shop Management tool in python. Which uses MySQL to store data.

Required Software:
1. MySQL

Required Python Libraries/Modules:
1. mysql-connector
2. maskpass
3. prettytable

How to use:
1. install required software, libraries in your system.
2. now all you have to do is run the 'main.py' file, and done.

I hope you will love the project, suggestions are invited. :)
Thank You.
